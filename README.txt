Project One - CS400 @ UW Madison
Group: DQ
TEAM: red

Things that went well for this team through project two:

Discussed collaboratively on a practical approach and decided on an excellent topic "Car Catalog App"

More data can be implemented in future projects, i.e., the catalog can hold more information about cars such as year of manufacture.
